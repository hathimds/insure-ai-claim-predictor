# 📌 Health Insurance Cost Prediction (Python + ML + Streamlit)

## 📖 Overview  
This project predicts health insurance costs based on customer attributes such as age, BMI, smoking status, and other personal factors. The model is deployed as a web application for real-time estimation.

## 🎯 Objective  
To build and deploy a machine learning model that accurately estimates insurance costs and helps understand key factors influencing premiums.

## 📊 What I Did  
- Performed data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and feature preprocessing.  
- Applied label encoding to categorical variables and standardized numerical features.  
- Tuned multiple models using GridSearchCV and selected an XGBoost model with R² = 0.84.  
- Built and deployed an interactive Streamlit application for real-time cost prediction.

## 🛠️ Tools Used  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Streamlit  

## 🔍 Key Insights  
- Smoking status had a strong impact on insurance charges.  
- Age and BMI were significant predictors of higher premiums.  
- Feature scaling and hyperparameter tuning improved model performance.
